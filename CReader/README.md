An unexpected update for Android 2.X. We release FBReader 2.6.14 as Google blocks WebView based authentication on April 20, 2017. (Details: https://developers.googleblog.com/2016/08/modernizing-oauth-interactions-in-native-apps.html.) This version starts Web Browser to authenticate user in FBReader Book Network https://books.fbreader.org/.

All the sources are still under the GPL.
